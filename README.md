* Enable: Painting with Tome
* Send the regco to the backend for NLP
* Ask question if Tom meets a person for the first time
    * ask if that person is serious or light-hearted
    * serious:
        * What is a challenge you would never want to face?
        * If you could do so, how would you change the world?
    * light-hearted
        *  What gift have you received that you will always treasure?
        *  Do you have any family traditions? If so, what?
